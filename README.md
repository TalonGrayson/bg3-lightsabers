## Baldur's Gate 3 Mod: Red Lightsaber

I wanted a way augment my sithy durge character to give him some more 'force-user' feeling buffs and such. I figured lightsabers would be a good way to do this, and the idea quickly snowballed.

The `RedLightsaber` folder is what gets packed into the .pak
Other folders are transient/projects files/etc

### Primary Objectives:
- Lightsaber with red blade (custom mesh)
    [x] Placeholder models
    [] Placeholder textures (correctly mapped)
    [] Final models
    [] Final textures (correctly mapped)
- Illuminate surroundings when not sheathed
- Add some passives:
    - Perception advantage
    - +dexterity
    - Missile Snaring

### Secondary Objectives:
- Hide blades when sheathed
- Consider buffing/debuffing various stats when dual-wielding
- Balance "Versatile" rolls

### Long term goals:
- Some sort of scaling on the weapon so it can be carried through an entire campaign
- Some way of changing the blade colour
- A Force user class... eventually
